List Unspent Transaction Outputs By Address

Through this endpoint customers can list their transactions' unspent outputs by `address`.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using CryptoAPIs.Api;
using CryptoAPIs.Client;
using CryptoAPIs.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class ListUnspentTransactionOutputsByAddressExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://rest.cryptoapis.io/v2";
            // Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
            config.AddApiKey("x-api-key", "YOUR_API_KEY");
            // Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
            // config.AddApiKeyPrefix("x-api-key", "Bearer");

            var apiInstance = new UTXOBasedApi(config);
            var blockchain = bitcoin;  // string | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
            var network = testnet;  // string | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\" are test networks.
            var address = 2MtzNEqm2D9jcbPJ5mW7Z3AUNwqt3afZH66;  // string | Represents the public address, which is a compressed and shortened form of a public key.
            var context = context_example;  // string | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user. (optional) 
            var limit = 50;  // int? | Defines how many items should be returned in the response per page basis. (optional)  (default to 50)
            var offset = 0;  // int? | The starting index of the response items, i.e. where the response should start listing the returned items. (optional)  (default to 0)

            try
            {
                // List Unspent Transaction Outputs By Address
                ListUnspentTransactionOutputsByAddressR result = apiInstance.ListUnspentTransactionOutputsByAddress(blockchain, network, address, context, limit, offset);
                Debug.WriteLine(result);
            }
            catch (ApiException  e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception when calling UTXOBasedApi.ListUnspentTransactionOutputsByAddress: " + e.Message );
                Debug.Print("Status Code: "+ e.ErrorCode);
                Debug.Print(e.StackTrace);
            }
        }
    }
}
