Get Latest Mined XRP (Ripple) Block

Through this endpoint customers can fetch the last mined XRP block in the blockchain, along with its details. These could include the hash of the specific, the previous and the next block, its transactions count, its height, etc.     Since XRP is a different blockchain than Bitcoin and Ethereum, it isn't unified.

# **GetXRPRippleAddressDetails**
> GetXRPRippleAddressDetailsResponse GetXRPRippleAddressDetails (string network, string address, string context = null)

Get XRP (Ripple) Address Details

Through this endpoint the customer can receive basic information about a given XRP address based on confirmed/synced blocks only. In the case where there are any incoming or outgoing **unconfirmed** transactions for the specific address, they **will not** be counted or calculated here.    Since XRP is a different blockchain than Bitcoin and Ethereum, it isn't unified.

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **network** | **string**| Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \&quot;mainnet\&quot; is the live network with actual data while networks like \&quot;testnet\&quot;, \&quot;ropsten\&quot;, \&quot;rinkeby\&quot; are test networks. | 
 **transactionHash** | **string**| Represents the same as &#x60;transactionId&#x60; for account-based protocols like Ethereum, while it could be different in UTXO-based protocols like Bitcoin. E.g., in UTXO-based protocols &#x60;hash&#x60; is different from &#x60;transactionId&#x60; for SegWit transactions. | 
 **context** | **string**| In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. &#x60;context&#x60; is specified by the user. | [optional]

# **ListXRPRippleTransactionsByAddress**
> ListXRPRippleTransactionsByAddressResponse ListXRPRippleTransactionsByAddress (string network, string address, string context = null, int? limit = null, int? offset = null)

List XRP (Ripple) Transactions by Address

This endpoint will list XRP transactions by a attribute `address`. The transactions listed will detail additional information such as hash, height, time of creation in Unix timestamp, etc.    Since XRP is a different blockchain than Bitcoin and Ethereum, it isn't unified.
