Get Asset Details By Asset ID

Through this endpoint users can obtain information on assets by `assetId`.    The details returned could include information on the latest rate and rate fluctuation of different periods of time - 24 hours, a week, one hour, the encoding of the logo, and more.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using CryptoAPIs.Api;
using CryptoAPIs.Client;
using CryptoAPIs.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class GetAssetDetailsByAssetIDExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://rest.cryptoapis.io/v2";
            // Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
            config.AddApiKey("x-api-key", "YOUR_API_KEY");
            // Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
            // config.AddApiKeyPrefix("x-api-key", "Bearer");

            var apiInstance = new AssetsApi(config);
            var assetId = 5b1ea92e584bf50020130612;  // string | Defines the unique ID of the specific asset.
            var context = context_example;  // string | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user. (optional) 

            try
            {
                // Get Asset Details By Asset ID
                GetAssetDetailsByAssetIDR result = apiInstance.GetAssetDetailsByAssetID(assetId, context);
                Debug.WriteLine(result);

List Assets Details

This endpoint will return a list of details on assets. These could be cryptocurrencies or FIAT assets that we support. Each asset has a unique identifier - `assetId` and a unique symbol in the form of a string, e.g. \"BTC\".    The details returned could include information on the latest rate and rate fluctuation of different periods of time - 24 hours, a week, one hour, the encoding of the logo, and more.
