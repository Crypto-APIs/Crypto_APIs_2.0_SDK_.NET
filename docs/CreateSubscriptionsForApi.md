> MinedTransactionR MinedTransaction (string blockchain, string network, string context = null, MinedTransactionRB minedTransactionRB = null)

Mined transaction

Through this endpoint customers can create callback subscriptions for a specific event. In this case the event is when a specific transaction is mined. By creating this subscription the user will be notified by Crypto APIs 2.0 when that event occurs. The information is returned per specified `transactionId`.    A transaction is mined when it is included in a new block in the blockchain.    {note}To have an operational callback subscription, you need to first verify a domain for the Callback URL. Please see more information on Callbacks [here](https://developers.cryptoapis.io/technical-documentation/general-information/callbacks#callback-url).{/note}    {warning}Crypto APIs will notify the user **only when** the event occurs. There are cases when the specific event doesn't happen at all, or takes a long time to do so. A callback notification **will not** be sent if the event does not or cannot occur, or will take long time to occur.{/warning}

# **NewConfirmedTokensTransactionsAndEachConfirmation**
> NewConfirmedTokensTransactionsAndEachConfirmationR NewConfirmedTokensTransactionsAndEachConfirmation (string blockchain, string network, string context = null, NewConfirmedTokensTransactionsAndEachConfirmationRB newConfirmedTokensTransactionsAndEachConfirmationRB = null)

New confirmed tokens transactions and each confirmation

Through this endpoint customers can create callback subscriptions for a specific event. In this case the event is when there are new incoming or outgoing confirmed transactions for tokens from/to the customer's address with also a response at each confirmation the transaction has received until the specified confirmations limit is reached. By creating this subscription the user will be notified by Crypto APIs 2.0 when that event occurs. The information is returned per specified address.     Being confirmed means that the transactions are verified by miners and added to the next block. This endpoint refers to **tokens transactions only, not coins**.    {note}To have an operational callback subscription, you need to first verify a domain for the Callback URL.
