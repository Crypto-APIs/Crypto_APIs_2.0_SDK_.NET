Validate Address

This endpoint checks user public addresses whether they are valid or not.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using CryptoAPIs.Api;
using CryptoAPIs.Client;
using CryptoAPIs.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class ValidateAddressExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://rest.cryptoapis.io/v2";
            // Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
            config.AddApiKey("x-api-key", "YOUR_API_KEY");
            // Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
            // config.AddApiKeyPrefix("x-api-key", "Bearer");

            var apiInstance = new ValidatingApi(config);
            var blockchain = bitcoin;  // string | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
            var network = testnet;  // string | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\", \"rinkeby\" are test networks.
            var context = context_example;  // string | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user. (optional) 
            var validateAddressRB = new ValidateAddressRB(); // ValidateAddressRB |  (optional) 

            try
            {
                // Validate Address
                ValidateAddressR result = apiInstance.ValidateAddress(blockchain, network, context, validateAddressRB);
                Debug.WriteLine(result);
            }
            catch (ApiException  e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception when calling ValidatingApi.ValidateAddress: " + e.Message );
                Debug.Print("Status Code: "+ e.ErrorCode);
                Debug.Print(e.StackTrace);
            }
        }
    }
