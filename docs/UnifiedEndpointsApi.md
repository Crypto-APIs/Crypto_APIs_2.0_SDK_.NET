Get Address Details

Through this endpoint the customer can receive basic information about a given address based on confirmed/synced blocks only. In the case where there are any incoming or outgoing **unconfirmed** transactions for the specific address, they **will not** be counted or calculated here.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using CryptoAPIs.Api;
using CryptoAPIs.Client;
using CryptoAPIs.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class GetAddressDetailsExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://rest.cryptoapis.io/v2";
            // Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
            config.AddApiKey("x-api-key", "YOUR_API_KEY");
            // Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
            // config.AddApiKeyPrefix("x-api-key", "Bearer");

            var apiInstance = new UnifiedEndpointsApi(config);
            var blockchain = bitcoin;  // string | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
            var network = testnet;  // string | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\", \"rinkeby\" are test networks.
            var address = mzYijhgmzZrmuB7wBDazRKirnChKyow4M3;  // string | Represents the public address, which is a compressed and shortened form of a public key.
            var context = context_example;  // string | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user. (optional) 

            try
            {
                // Get Address Details
                GetAddressDetailsR result = apiInstance.GetAddressDetails(blockchain, network, address, context);
                Debug.WriteLine(result);
            }
            catch (ApiException  e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception when calling UnifiedEndpointsApi.GetAddressDetails: " + e.Message );

                Debug.Print(e.StackTrace);
            }
        }
    }

Get Fee Recommendations

Through this endpoint customers can obtain fee recommendations. Our fees recommendations are based on Mempool data which makes them much more accurate than fees based on already mined blocks. Calculations are done in real time live. Using this endpoint customers can get gas price for Ethereum, fee per byte for Bitcoin, etc.

# **GetTransactionDetailsByTransactionID**
> GetTransactionDetailsByTransactionIDR GetTransactionDetailsByTransactionID (string blockchain, string network, string transactionId, string context = null)

Get Transaction Details By Transaction ID

Through this endpoint customers can obtain details about a transaction by the transaction's unique identifier. In UTXO-based protocols like BTC there are attributes such as `transactionId` and transaction `hash`. They still could be different. In protocols like Ethereum there is only one unique value and it's `hash`.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using CryptoAPIs.Api;
using CryptoAPIs.Client;
using CryptoAPIs.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class GetTransactionDetailsByTransactionIDExample

            config.AddApiKey("x-api-key", "YOUR_API_KEY");
            // Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
            // config.AddApiKeyPrefix("x-api-key", "Bearer");

            var apiInstance = new UnifiedEndpointsApi(config);
            var blockchain = bitcoin;  // string | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
            var network = testnet;  // string | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\", \"rinkeby\" are test networks.
            var transactionId = 4b66461bf88b61e1e4326356534c135129defb504c7acb2fd6c92697d79eb250;  // string | Represents the unique identifier of a transaction, i.e. it could be `transactionId` in UTXO-based protocols like Bitcoin, and transaction `hash` in Ethereum blockchain.
