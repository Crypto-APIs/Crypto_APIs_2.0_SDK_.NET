## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Difficulty** | **string** | Represents a mathematical value of how hard it is to find a valid hash for this block. | 
**Nonce** | **string** | Represents a random value that can be adjusted to satisfy the Proof of Work | 
**Size** | **int** | Represents the total size of the block in Bytes. | 
**Bits** | **string** | Represents a specific sub-unit of Dash. Bits have two-decimal precision. | 
**Chainwork** | **string** | Represents a hexadecimal number of all the hashes necessary to produce the current chain. E.g., when converting 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000086859f7a841475b236fd to a decimal you get 635262017308958427068157 hashes, or 635262 exahashes. | 
**MerkleRoot** | **string** | Defines the single and final (root) node of a Merkle tree. It is the combined hash of all transactions&#39; hashes that are part of a blockchain block. | 
**StrippedSize** | **int** | Defines the numeric representation of the block size excluding the witness data. | 
**Version** | **int** | Represents the version of the specific block on the blockchain. | 
**VersionHex** | **string** | Is the hexadecimal string representation of the block&#39;s version. | 
**Weight** | **int** | Represents a measurement to compare the size of different transactions to each other in proportion to the block size limit. | 
**ExtraData** | **string** | Represents any data that can be included by the miner in the block. | 
**GasLimit** | **string** | Defines the total gas limit of all transactions in the block. | 
**GasUsed** | **string** | Represents the total amount of gas used by all transactions in this block. | 
**MinedInSeconds** | **int** | Specifies the amount of time required for the block to be mined in seconds. | 
**Sha3Uncles** | **string** | Defines the combined hash of all uncles for a given parent. | 
**TotalDifficulty** | **string** | Defines the total difficulty of the chain until this block, i.e. how difficult it is for a specific miner to mine a new block. |
