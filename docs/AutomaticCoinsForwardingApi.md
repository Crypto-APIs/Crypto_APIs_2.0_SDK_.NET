Create Automatic Coins Forwarding

Through this endpoint customers can set up an automatic forwarding function specifically for coins (**not** tokens). They can have a `toAddress` which is essentially the main address and the destination for the automatic coins forwarding.     There is also a `minimumTransferAmount` which only when reached will then trigger the forwarding. Through this the customer can save from fees.    Moreover, `feePriority` can be also set,  which defines how quickly to move the coins once they are received. The higher priority, the larger the fee will be. It can be \"SLOW\", \"STANDARD\" or \"FAST\".    The response of this endpoint contains an attribute `fromAddress` which can be used as a deposit address. Any funds received by this address will be automatically forwarded to `toAddress` based on what the customer has set for the automation.    For this automatic forwarding the customer can set a callback subscription.    {warning}The subscription will work for all incoming transactions until it is deleted. There is no need to do that for every transaction.{/warning}    {note}This endpoint generates a new `fromAddress` each time.{/note}
