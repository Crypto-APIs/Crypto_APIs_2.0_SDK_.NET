Get Token Details by Contract Address

Though this endpoint customers can obtain information about token details. This can be done by providing the `contact address` parameter.    {note}This address is **not** the same as the smart contract creator address.{/note}

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using CryptoAPIs.Api;
using CryptoAPIs.Client;
using CryptoAPIs.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class GetTokenDetailsByContractAddressExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://rest.cryptoapis.io/v2";
            // Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
            config.AddApiKey("x-api-key", "YOUR_API_KEY");
            // Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
            // config.AddApiKeyPrefix("x-api-key", "Bearer");

            var apiInstance = new TokensApi(config);
            var blockchain = ethereum;  // string | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc. (default to ethereum)
            var network = ropsten;  // string | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\" are test networks.
            var contractAddress = 0x7495fede000c8a3b77eeae09cf70fa94cd2d53f5;  // string | Defines the specific address of the contract.
            var context = yourExampleString;  // string | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user. (optional) 

            try
            {
                // Get Token Details by Contract Address
                GetTokenDetailsByContractAddressR result = apiInstance.GetTokenDetailsByContractAddress(blockchain, network, contractAddress, context);
                Debug.WriteLine(result);
            }
            catch (ApiException  e)
            {

                Debug.Print(e.StackTrace);
            }
        }
    }
}
